# Runforge

Runforge is an orchestrator of CI runners for companies building software. It acts as a bridge between Git forges (e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/)), and cloud providers (e.g. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), [Scaleway](ttps://www.scaleway.com/en/)).
